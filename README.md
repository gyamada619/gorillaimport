# Gorilla Import

A script to help import packages into a gorilla catalog for software distribution on Windows.

The script assumes it is being run inside the [gorilla](https://github.com/1dustindavis/gorilla) repository.
It collects the following:

1. Item Name
2. Display Name
3. Package Path
4. Version

It also generates an SHA 256 hash of the installer file being imported.
